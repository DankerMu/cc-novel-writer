# Fixtures (Regression Scripts)

This directory contains **small synthetic fixtures** for testing the M3 evaluation/regression scripts without a full novel project.

- `demo-project/`: a minimal project-shaped directory with `evaluations/`, `logs/`, and a few optional files.

These fixtures are **not** meant to be realistic story content; they exist only to keep scripts runnable/regression-friendly.
